# The Role of Adaptive Optimizers for Honest Private Hyperparameter Selection
This is the codebase for the paper [The Role of Adaptive Optimizers
for Honest Private Hyperparameter Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04906.pdf) at AAAI'2022

Prerequisites
===
This project runs on Python 3.6 and necessary installation packages are in requirements.txt
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary packages

The CONFIG.py can be used to tweak hyperparameters
The variable_parameters_dict can be used to run multiple hyperparameters.

Run using `python3 main.py [data_location]`
